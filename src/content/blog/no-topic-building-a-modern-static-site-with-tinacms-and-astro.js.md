Bloggers all need help with maintaining their content. That's why choosing a good Content Management System (CMS for short) is very important. We have to choose a CMS which is scalable, open, and without a vendor lock-in. We have several CMSs which are very good in their belt hitting way above their weight like Ghost CMS, Sanity, WordPress, and many more But I recently came across [Tina](https://tina.io "Tina") which is a git-based CMS which is unique and open. Let me introduce why Tina might be the best cms for your blog.

\## Why TinaCMS is best for content management?

\### Git Based:

While there are many CMS which provide API. This is one of the unique ones where all the content is stored in markdown format in a git repository without any vendor lock-in. On top of all this, you can leverage the benefits of git to your advantage such as commit history, tracking, environments, etc.

\### Open Source:

[TinaCMS](https://github.com/tinacms/tinacms "TinaCMS") started as an open-source project. Even now after the acquisition by an Australian firm, it is still committed by the firm and community to stay open source.

\### Inline Editing:

TinaCMS features inline editing, allowing you to update content directly on your website with a live preview. This intuitive editing experience streamlines content creation and management, making it accessible and efficient for users of all technical levels.

\## How I am using the Tina CMS

I am using Tina CMS for this [blog](https://udaysamsani.com "blog"). The first thing that I did after setting Tina was to configure all the frontmatter properties for my markdown blog posts so that I could access them in my Astro markdown props. Apart from that I have changed my static media upload from git source to Cloudinary CDN for better image processing and image delivery.

Here are some snippets of how I configured the frontmatter properties and Static images handler.

```javascript
{
  media: {
    // cloudinary  
    loadCustomStore: async () => {
      const pack = await import("next-tinacms-cloudinary");
      return pack.TinaCloudCloudinaryMediaStore;
    },  
	},
}
```

```javascript
{
  name: "blog",
    label: "Blogs",
      path: "src/content/blog",
        format: "md",
          fields: [
            {
              type: "string",
              name: "title",
              label: "Title",
              isTitle: true,
              required: true,
              ui: {
                validate: (value, data) => {
                  const lengthOfTitle = value?.length || 0;
                  const lengthOfDescription = data?.description?.length || 0;
                  if (lengthOfTitle >= lengthOfDescription) {
                    return "The description must be longer than the title";
                  }
                },
              },
            },
            {
              type: "boolean",
              name: "draft",
              label: "Draft",
            },
            {
              type: "string",
              name: "tags",
              label: "Tags",
              list: true,
            },
            {
              type: "rich-text",
              name: "body",
              label: "Body",
              isBody: true,
              templates: [
                {
                  name: "Callout",
                  label: "Callout",
                  fields: [{
                    name: "message",
                    label: "Message",
                    type: "string",
                  },
                  ],
                },
              ],
