If you're preparing for the Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) certification, effective note-taking becomes crucial for organising your research, documenting your findings, and maintaining a knowledge base for future reference. While there are numerous note-taking apps available like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), [Logseq](https://logseq.com/), [Bear](https://bear.app/), [Cherry Tree](https://www.giuspen.net/cherrytree/) and many more that I haven't even explored. But [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) stands out as a powerful tool that can greatly enhance your OSCP preparation journey. In this article, I will let you know why Obsidian is the ideal companion for OSCP and discuss its edge over other alternatives.

Every one who tried Obsidian before agrees with me here, that obsidian has an extensive plugin ecosystem. Obsidian offers a wide range of community-developed plugins that can be easily installed to enhance the app's functionality and tailor fit your specific needs. When preparing for OSCP, this flexibility becomes invaluable.

You can leverage plugins like

- **Templater** to create templates for your future notes to have certain template structure.
- **Obsidian Git** to make your entire obsidian notes vault a git repo to make it portable.
- **Dataview** to organize and view the notes and data to your custom index pages.
- **Kanban** to maintain a Kanban board to track different things effectively.

And many more [plugins](https://obsidian.md/plugins), all those integrate together to make Obsidian a treat to use.

## Open Source (its free forever)

Obsidian is an open source project built by community members that means its free for everyone forever. New features, improvements, bug fixes are all developed by community and trust me obsidian has a very great and active community.

## Markdown First: Focus on Content and Portability

Obsidian is built with a "Markdown first" approach, which means it formatting using Markdown syntax. Markdown allows you to structure and format your notes in a lightweight, human-readable format that emphasises content rather than visual distractions. You can easily create headings, lists, tables, code blocks, and more, ensuring your notes are well-organized and easily scannable. Additionally, Markdown files are highly portable, which is essential for a certification like OSCP where you may need to access your notes across multiple devices or platforms.

## Vibrant Community for Themes

Obsidian has a thriving community of users who actively share their themes and contribute to the ever-growing collection of user-created themes. This vibrant community ensures that you have access to a wide range of visually stunning themes, catering to different tastes and preferences. Whether you're looking for a professional-looking theme or a creative and colorful design, the Obsidian community is a treasure trove of inspiration.

## Conclusion

At the end of the day you can even work you way to OSCP with notes taken down with pen and paper. Its just that the convenience you will have if you have a software copy so that you search, or have multiple backups or have a easy access to references. If you haven't tried Obsidian try it out once for taking and organising your thoughts I am sure you will find it useful just like me.
